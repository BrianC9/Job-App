Nos dedicamos a hacer un producto de software para que la gente que ha estudiado ADE, Económicas, Biología, Caminos o Periodismo... puedan hacer análisis avanzado de datos. Para aquellos a los que Excel y los dashboards se les quedan cortos.\n\nCon Graphext intentamos que esos analistas, consigan hacer cosas más "predictivas" y “preescriptivas” para sacar conclusiones de los datos como si hubieran estudiado Matemáticas, Física o Informática y supieran escribir código en Python o R... para más de 50 casos de uso que vamos encontrando. Desde desarrollar fármacos nuevos, a entender por qué se producen ciertos crímenes o por qué se van los empleados de una empresa.\n\nCreemos que las herramientas que hay ahora mismo en el mercado limitan o impiden que muchos de estos analistas las pueda usar porque: necesitas saber programar, no te guían prácticamente nada para descubrir qué funciones de limpieza de datos, enriquecimiento o algoritmia puedes usar para resolver determinados problemas de negocio, son muy poco interactivas y lentas (human in the loop), y sólo te dejan trabajar con datos estructurados (numéricos y categóricos) y se olvidan de todo lo que hoy día con machine learning se puede sacar de információn desesctructurada (textos e imágenes).\nCómo es el producto\n\nEn nuestra web puedes ver cómo funciona el producto.\n\nY en nuestro canal de Youtube encontrarás vídeos más explícitos: como este ejemplo o este otro de tipos de análisis que se pueden hacer.\n\nEn nuestro Twitter y blog también solemos poner más ejemplos regularmente de análisis que vamos haciendo.\n¿Por qué hacéis este producto?\n\nEs una larga historia que puedes escuchar un podcast de 45 minutos donde nuestros inversores nos entrevistan.\n¿Es una empresa seria?\n\nEmpezamos hace más de 5 años, pero no fue hasta hace 3 y medio que recibimos una inversión relevante de nuestro principal inversor KFund. En total hemos levantado 1.4M de fondos de inversión privados y recibido 1.7M del H2020 un fondo europeo para startups innovadoras.\n\nAdemás de la inversión recibida para crear el producto de la nada, vamos añadiendo clientes nuevos mes a mes que ya representan cerca del 50% de los ingresos respecto al gasto. Lo cual hacen que la empresa tenga la existencia garantizada por unos años incluso en el peor de los escenarios posibles. Todavía queda mucho 2020, qué será lo siguiente!?\nQué perfil estamos buscando\n\nBuscamos a alguien que tenga experiencia desarrollando software para la web. Solemos preferir perfiles más generalistas que especialistas. O si has trabajado en videojuegos o en backend, pero te interesa el desarrollo web este también es un buen sitio para desarrollarte. Aunque esta posición está orientada a alguien que principalmente estará desarrollando lógica reactiva y componentes de React con Typescript, si no te da miedo (o te gustaría aprender) a tocar un backend en Rails o incluso código en C++ que también usamos en el frontend vía WebAssembly (Aquí una charla sobre cómo usamos WebAssembly por si tienes curiosidad) pues mejor que mejor.\nLo que esperamos de ti:\n• Fundamentos sólidos de estructuras de datos y algoritmia. Manejar tantos datos de forma interactiva nos fuerzan a tener el uso de memoria y CPU en mente. No es raro tener abierto el profiler.\n• Más de tres años de experiencia trabajando con Javascript usando algún framework moderno para la creación de Single Page Applications. Conocimientos de Typescript y React son muy valorados pero no imprescindibles.\n• Soltura con código asíncrono (promesas, async & await) y reactivo (usamos mobx para manejar el estado)\n• Conocimientos sólidos del stack de tecnologías web end to end (e.g. DOM, CSS, HTTP, cookies, headers, asset loading / caching).\n• Atención al detalle y disciplina a la hora de probar y asegurar la calidad del código.\n• Competencia en inglés, normalmente hablamos en español pero no es raro escribir y mantener una conversación en inglés.\nSumas puntos extra si...\n\nValoramos grados en informática o estudios similares porque sabemos los cimientos que proporcionan, pero también sabemos que un título no garantiza nada, así que no ponemos como requisito tener títulos oficiales.\n\nSi has hecho visualización de datos con librerías como d3.js también es buena señal de que encajas.\n¿Cómo es trabajar en Graphext?\n   Con quién trabajarías\n\nAl frente del front    está Juan Morales, que además de programar, también diseña la interfaz junto con nuestra diseñadora Cristina. Y lo hace, porque aunque Juan es informático de formación, acabó haciendo un doctorado en human computer interaction aplicado justamente a diseñar interfaces de análisis de datos. Así que no va a diseñar nada que sepa que es imposible de programar, pero sí intentará que explotemos al límite lo que se puede hacer hoy día sobre un navegador.\n\nEn el equipo de frontend también trabajarás con Isa y Nacho. Ambos llevan ya 2 años también con nosotros y han creado muchas de las features más claves del producto. Aunque el foco de ambos en Graphext está en frontend, también tienen experiencia y ayudan con tareas de backend.\n\nPor otro lado, Miguel (el CTO y co-fundador) e Ian también contribuyen al desarrollo del frontend de la aplicación pero más desde el lado de Webassembly y WebGL, creando una capa que trata de optimizar al máximo las operaciones que se hacen sobre los datos.\n\nAdemás de todos estos programadores, el equipo tiene más gente maja trabajando en producto, data science y negocio que puedes ver aquí.\n  Compensación\n• Salario entre 30 y 45K euros brutos anuales. Dependerá de tu experiencia y autonomía. Los salarios de casi todo el equipo están en ese rango también.\n• Contrato indefinido.\n• Pagamos la mitad de seguro médico y dental privado.\n• Puedes elegir tu propio equipo. Aunque la mayoría trabajan con Macbook Pro también puede elegir otro ordenador de similares caracterísitcas. También te dotamos de pantalla, teclado, ratón en la oficina.\n   Dónde y cuándo\n\nNuestras oficinas están en pleno centro de Madrid, en la Puerta del Sol, en la Calle Preciados 7 concretamente. Puedes ver fotos en nuestro Instagram. Las compartimos con un estudio de diseño bastante chulo, Mendesaltarén.\n\nActualmente todo el equipo, dada la situación, está trabajando plenamente en remoto.\n\nEn la vieja o nueva normalidad somos muy flexibles con cómo repartes tus horas de trabajo. Pensamos que vernos en persona a menudo tiene mucho valor. No todos los días, pero sí a menudo. Por eso puedes quedarte a trabajar en casa varios días a la semana sin problema, pero esperamos verte por la oficina también durante la semana. Somos un equipo pequeño y las relaciones de confianza que se generan o la capacidad de pensar en cosas creativas fuera del roadmap, de momento, pensamos que funcionan mejor en persona que a través de una videollamada.\n\nLo mismo con tus días de vacaciones. Puedes repartirlos a lo largo del año con toda la flexibilidad, coordinandote un poco antes con tus compañeros.\n  Con qué valores\n• Tenemos una cultura basada en la responsabilidad, somos pocos y no queremos tener más capitanes que marineros, así que contratamos gente de la que esperamos poder confiar sin tener que estar supervisando constantemente, con una motivación instrínsica por seguir creciendo profesionalmente.\n• Nos gusta la honestidad y transparencia. Creemos que casi todos los problemas gordos empiezan como maletendidos pequeños que suelen tener que ver con cierta falta de confianza que nace de no tener información suficiente.\n• Procuramos crear un ambiente donde la gente pueda hablar libremente, ser auténtica y empática al mismo tiempo con todos los compañeros del equipo.\n• Tratamos de tener las mínimas reuniones posibles. Como desarrollador participarás una daily diaria de 15-20 minutos a las 12 de la mañana y un sprint meeting de unas 2 horas cada dos semanas. El resto serán reuniones individuales con la gente en la que estés trabajando en algo concreto.\n• Aunque somos una startup, entendemos que para ganar de verdad, esta va a ser una carrera larga y cuidamos de que nadie se queme. Si un día echas más horas de lo normal porque tenías flow (estabas inspirado) y querías acabar algo o había un fuego que apagar, trabajarás menos horas al día siguiente. No te vamos a tener días o semanas esprintando.\n• Esperemos que entiendas y hables inglés. No tiene que ser perfecto, pero sí suficiente para poder comunicarte. Por tu posición en el equipo, de momento, te relacionaras casi siempre con gente que hable español, pero somos una empresa con mentalidad global. Casi todas las comunicaciones externas e internas de la empresa se hacen en inglés, porque hacemos un producto para cualquier persona del mundo. Además tenemos miembros en el equipo que son extranjeros, que no necesariamente necesitan saber hablar español, y esperamos que con los años sigamos sumando extranjeros al equipo.',
